# Schemas

ModForge-CLI is built around **schema‑driven configuration**. These schemas define how the CLI interprets policies, resolves dependencies, and interacts with external APIs.

---

## 📜 Policy Schema

**File:** `policy.schema.yml`

Defines:

* Mod inclusion rules
* Conflict resolution
* Sub‑mod expansion
* Conditional dependencies

This schema ensures that modpacks are **predictable, reproducible, and self‑documenting**.

## 🔌 Modrinth API Schema

**File:** `modrinth_api.schema.yml`

Defines:

* Supported Modrinth API endpoints
* Request and response shapes
* Version and loader mappings

This allows ModForge-CLI to validate API interactions at runtime and during development.

## 🛠 Why Schemas Matter

Schemas provide:

* Early error detection
* Strong validation guarantees
* IDE auto‑completion
* Long‑term stability

They are a core design principle of ModForge-CLI.
